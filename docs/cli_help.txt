USAGE:
    cli <command>

COMMANDS:
    build
            Build the project's docker image. The resulting image is used
            as a baseline for the "run" and "tmp" commands.

    run
            Run the test automation suite. The test reports will be copied
            to the current directory and then it will delete the container.
            This will also build the image if it does not exist yet. This
            will also persist the final state in a new image that would be
            used as a baseline for the "debug" command.

    debug
            Run a temporary container to inspect the state of the last run.

    tmp
            Run a temporary container.

    clean
            Remove unused docker containers and images.
